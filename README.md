# todo_application
## Getting Started

In this project , it has enough function and screen required, each screen have a list of task,
each task in list you can switch from right to left to update and delete task.

In project has some folder
    -   model/task.dart 
    -   provider/task_provider (used for handle logic: add, remove, update task)
    -   page/home_page (screen displayed for user)
    -   widgets (custom widget for screen displayed)

### test
In unit test (test/title_task_validator), I write test case when user create or update task, if title of task is empty and
has less than 3 character then show error.

Widget test (test/widget_test), Integration test (integration_test/app_test),
I'm not done yet
